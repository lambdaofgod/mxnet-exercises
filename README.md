# MXNet Exercises

Based on [Tensorflow Exercises](https://github.com/Kyubyong/tensorflow-exercises) project.

From original project's description:

> This is designed to help those who want to familiarize themselves with TensorFlow functions. Particulary, I focus on comparing TensorFlow functions with the equivalent functions in NumPy, the de facto standard numerical computation library. I hope this will help you get comfortable with TensorFlow quickly.

I have changed these examples to use MXNet. I deleted some exercises that didn't make sense for MXNet. I also used different sources for some notebooks (for example *Variables* notebook is adapted from Kyubyong's [PyTorch exercises](https://github.com/keon/pytorch-exercises)). 

### Useful links:

[A practicioner's guide to MXNet](http://home.cse.ust.hk/~xshiab/data/MXNet.pdf) - brief tutorial with simple code examples

[MXNet - the straight dope](https://github.com/zackchase/mxnet-the-straight-dope) - notebook-style deep learning course

[Deep learning implementations and frameworks tutorial](https://sites.google.com/site/dliftutorial/) - compares different frameworks. May be esp. useful for people who know how to program in a different DL framework.
