# MXNet Exercises

Based on [Tensorflow Exercises](https://github.com/Kyubyong/tensorflow-exercises) project.

From original project's description:

> This is designed to help those who want to familiarize themselves with TensorFlow functions. Particulary, I focus on comparing TensorFlow functions with the equivalent functions in NumPy, the de facto standard numerical computation library. I hope this will help you get comfortable with TensorFlow quickly.

I have changed these examples to use MXNet. I deleted some exercises that didn't make sense for MXNet. I also used different sources for some notebooks (for example *Variables* notebook is adapted from Kyubyong's [PyTorch exercises](https://github.com/keon/pytorch-exercises)). 

* Constants, Sequences, and Random Values (DONE)
* Graphs (DONE)
* Variables (DONE)
* Reading Data (WIP)
* Tensor Transformations (WIP)
* Math Part 1 (WIP)
* Math Part 2 (WIP)
* Math Part 3 (WIP)
* Strings (WIP)
* Control Flow (WIP)
* Images (WIP)
* Sparse Tensors (WIP)
* Neural Network Part 1 (WIP)
* Neural Network Part 2 (WIP)
* Neural Network Part 3 (WIP)
* Seq2Seq (WIP)
* Audio Processing (WIP)

Enjoy!
